Video game development has been a passion of mine since I first began programming.

## What is Ludum Dare?
Ludum Dare is a game development competition that takes place online. It is held three times a year, and developers have 48 or 72 hours to create a game based on a theme that is revealed at the start of the event. The competition is open to anyone, and the games can be created using any programming language or game engine. The goal of Ludum Dare is to encourage creativity, experimentation, and learning in game development. After the competition, participants can share their games and receive feedback from other developers and players.
