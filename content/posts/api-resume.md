# API Resume

I've launched a new version of my resume,
powered by Rust,
which is available as a RESTful API.

You can view the new site at https://api.dennislawter.me

## Features
- Support for a variety of OpenAPI specification viewers hosted directly on the site.
- A specialized static cache of `neofetch` for my hosting server: https://api.dennislawter.me/neofetch
